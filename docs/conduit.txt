Conduit
-------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Conduits are connected in a circuit, and can move items from their
inventory to another conduit in the same circuit.

When a conduit node is placed it has a simple form that asks for a channel.
This channel is both the digilines' channel and the target id of this
conduit within the circuit. A conduit does not have to be given a name.
Most of them are just used to connect other conduits together.

Transfer of items takes 0.1 seconds per conduit node moved.

Also acts as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will
take items from the top and sides, and release them from the bottom.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

UI

Channel - digilines channel/target id of circuit.
Target - target id/channel of circuit this circuit will transfer to.
Automatic - if checked transfers next item every second without command.
Top right 16 slot inventory - storage of items.
Bottom 32 slot inventory - player's inventory.

Mesecons
	Transfers the next item when power is turned on to the target circuit.

Digilines messages
"target <id>"
	Set the target of the conduit. id should be the channel of another
	conduit on the same circiut. This takes a moment to take effect, so
	delay any transfers.

"targets"
	Conduit will send a digilines message with its own channel in the form:
	{
		action = "targets",
		targets = { ... } -- list of string channels of all other conduits
								-- with a channel on the same circuit.
	}

"transfer"
	Simple transfer. Transfers the next item in the inventory to the target
	circuit (same as mesecons power).

table message
{
	action = "transfer",
	target = "<channel>",
	slot = <number>,
	item = "<itemname>"
}

	If target is not given, the circuit's set target is used.

	slot should be a number between 1 to 16. If the slot is empty nothing
	is transferred.

	item should be the registered item name. If the circuit's inventory
	does not contain any nothing is transferred.

	Only slot or item should be given. If both are given slot is used. If
	neither are given the next item in the inventory is transferred.
