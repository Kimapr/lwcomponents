Breaker
-------
* This block is only available if digilines and/or mesecons are loaded.

Breakers dig the node directly in front of them and drop the item at the
back of them. The node is only dug if the breaker has a tool that can
dig it, of if it can be dug by hand. The tool is worn if used. Also acts
as a digilines conductor. If the hopper mod is loaded, will take tools
from the top and sides.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.
