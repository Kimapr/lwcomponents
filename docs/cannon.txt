Cannon
------
This item is available without digilines or mesecons as it can be used
manually.

Contains a single inventory slot and shoots an item on command.
If the hopper mod is loaded, will take items from the top and sides, and
release them from the bottom.

Cannon rotation range:
side to side - +/-60 degrees (- = left, + = right)
down to up: -20 to 50 degrees (- = down, + = up)

To spawn entities from cannons include the lwcomponents_spawners mod.

Only the owner can dig or access the form of the locked version.

Digistuff game controller
Connect a game controller to the cannon with digilines cable. Enter the
game controller's channel in the Controller field of the cannon's form
(click Set). Your turning movements turn the cannon's barrel in the
direction the cannon is facing. The movements have an increased sensitivity
(x3) to try and keep the target in your view. Punching shoots an item.

register. A locked cannon can only be controlled by it's owner with a game
controller.
